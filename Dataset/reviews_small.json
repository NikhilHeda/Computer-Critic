True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books.

It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \"strange little book\" or \"the little black book\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \"The Counsels\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \"the poet-prophet par-excellence\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature.

Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper.

Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\"  Brian Bruya\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gibran's Prophet-worthy Poetic Wisdom", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"}

At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \"Love\", Gibran writes, \"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...\"  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading \"The Prophet\" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my \"human-ness\" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.

Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Transcend Human Subjectivity to Find Godlike Objectivity", "unixReviewTime": 980380800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2001"}

{"reviewerID": "AFY0BT42DDYZV", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "Enamorato", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "These days, Kahlil Gibran's \"The Prophet\" often gets dismissed as \"hippie\" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \"It Must be a cult,\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\"On Love\", \"On Work\", \"On Joy and Sorrow\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \"On Children\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \"Breaths.\"\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \"middle ground\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \"unwinding\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \"The Prophet\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's \"Search Inside\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with.

It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  \"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'\"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all \"cosmic\" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: \"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.\"Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this \"It Takes a Village\" gem: \"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\"  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  \"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.\"  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of \"The Prophet\" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'\"Forget that Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\"  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole \"one source, many wells\" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  \"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!\"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of \"love thy neighbor\" philosophy, it still defines \"good\" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a \"do unto others\" prescription, but \"You are good when you are one with yourself.\"If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, \"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.\"  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (\"a truth\") to God:\"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.\"Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  \"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!\"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (\"You are good when you are one with yourself,\" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of \"The Prophet.\"  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that \"The Prophet\" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that \"The Prophet\" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word \"hedon.\"  \"Hedonist\" sounds like a philosophical school, as does \"epicurean.\"  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Unfortunately, the twin credos of \"The Prophet\" are any path to God is the right path and if it feels good do it", "unixReviewTime": 1388534400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014"}

He stresses the importance of \"letting go\" rather than \"taking charge,\" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts.
