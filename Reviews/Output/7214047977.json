The reality is the way I use it you have two choices, flat, or slightly inclined.

It is exactly as pictured, the fit was great, and the price was right. The reason for the 4 stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the Kindel. You can't access either button while the case is on. Apparently when Kindel upgrades a tablet they don't change the name or add a number to it like Apple does with the iPad. I went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version Kindel and did not find anything.
